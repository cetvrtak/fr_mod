FR_NAME;French Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FR_DESC;The Peace of Paris signed on 3 September 1783, at Hartley's hotel in Paris, was the set of treaties that ended the American Revolutionary War. Traditional views of the French Revolution often attribute the financial crisis of the 1780s to heavy expenditure in this war.\n\nIn addition, the French population grew from 18 million in 1700 to 26 million in 1789, making it the most populous state in Europe. Inefficient agricultural methods meant domestic farmers could not support these numbers. Food shortages were particularly damaging for the regime, since many blamed price increases on government failure to prevent profiteering. By the spring of 1789, a poor harvest followed by a severe winter had created a rural peasantry with nothing to sell, and an urban proletariat whose purchasing power had collapsed.\n\nThe French Revolution began in May 1789 when the Ancien Regime was abolished in favour of a constitutional monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
