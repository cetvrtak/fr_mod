vauban_desc;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban was a French military engineer who served under Louis XIV. He is generally considered the greatest engineer of his time, and one of the most important in Western military history. His principles for fortifications were widely used for nearly 100 years, while aspects of his offensive tactics remained in use until the mid-twentieth century. While his modern fame rests on the fortifications he built, Vauban's greatest innovations were in offensive operations, an approach he summarised as 'More powder, less blood.';Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban;

levee_en_masse_desc;Levée en masse is a French term used for a policy of mass national conscription, often in the face of invasion. The concept originated during the French Revolutionary Wars, particularly for the period following 16 August 1793, when able-bodied men aged 18 to 25 were conscripted. It formed an integral part of the creation of national identity, making it distinct from forms of conscription which had existed before this date.;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;Levée en masse;

congreve_rocket_desc;The Congreve Rocket was a type of rocket artillery designed by British inventor Sir William Congreve in 1804. Congreve began in 1804 by buying the best rockets on the London market, but found that their greatest range was only 600 yards. After spending ‘several hundred pounds’ of his own money on experiments, he was able to make a rocket that would travel 1,500 yards.;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;Congreve Rocket;

napoleonic_square_desc;As used in the Napoleonic Wars, the formation was constituted as a hollow square or sometimes a rectangle, with each side composed of two or more ranks of soldiers armed with single-shot muskets or rifles with fixed bayonets. Once formed in square, the infantry would volley fire at approaching cavalry, either by file or by rank. In successful actions, the infantry would often withhold fire until the charging horses and men were about 30 m from the square; the resulting casualties to the attackers would eventually form piles of dead and wounded horses and their riders, which would obstruct further attacks.;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;Napoleonic Square;

napoleonic_combined_arms_desc;Combined Arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects.
